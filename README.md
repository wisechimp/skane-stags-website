<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (STARTER) -->
This is the website for Sk√•ne Stags Rugby League club. The site is based on Gatsby's bare bones hello-world starter.

The site is a functional [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) deployed on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and utilising [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) to reduce build time (by about 50%!).

Data for building the pages has been sourced from:

1. Local json files (the kit and results pages).
2. Local mdx files (the squad page, and this will be used for the player profile pages in the future).
3. A Wordpress.com blog (the news).
