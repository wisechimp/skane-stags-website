Current Swedish rugby league national champions Skåne Stags will be returning to action this Saturday in Malmö for the first time since the pandemic started. Appropriately enough we will be playing Czech side [Vrchlabi Mad Squirrels](http://www.rugby-vrchlabi.cz) were the last side we met in 2019. That [match](https://skanestags.com/news/20190814-vrchlabi-mad-squirrels-16-21-skane-stags-rugby-league) (Video: [first half](https://youtu.be/2YRB8OXcPrM), [second half](https://youtu.be/_AHc5pUwmtw)) was a close fought contest where the Stags only managed to overcome the home side at the end of 80 competitive minutes. The Czechs will be bringing a strong squad and Skåne will also be fielding a competitive team. Many of the Swedes in the matchday squad will be hoping to impress the Sweden Rugby League selectors in advance of Sweden's fixture against the Netherlands in Amsterdam this September.

<br />

The match will be played on the [Limhamnsfältet pitch](https://www.skanestags.com/training/) where we usually with kick off at 14:00. It's free to watch and our friends at [Port Malmö Aussie Rules FC](https://www.portmalmo.com) will be providing a BBQ.
