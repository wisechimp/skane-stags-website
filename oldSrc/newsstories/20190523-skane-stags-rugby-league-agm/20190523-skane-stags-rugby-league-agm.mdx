Skåne Stags will be holding their AGM at o’Learys in Lund on the 31st May at 18:00. All members past and present are welcome to come and share their ideas for how to take the club forward. The schedule for the evening will be refreshments before the committee present their summary for 2018. This will be followed by further refreshments if required before opening the meeting to the floor. If time allows we may also get a rugby league game up on one of the TV’s.
