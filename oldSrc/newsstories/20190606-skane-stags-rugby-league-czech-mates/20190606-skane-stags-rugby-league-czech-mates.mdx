This summer Skåne Stags have been invited to the Czech Republic to take on Vrchlabí Mad Squirrels. This will be an excellent trip as the Czechs are great hosts off the pitch and will provide a serious challenge on it. The match will be on Saturday the 3rd August and the plan will be to fly over the Friday and return on the Sunday.

<br />

The club will be organising and subsidising a group booking for flights so contact Sebastian to confirm your attendance and Swish over your deposit. Do it now, you’d be Mad not to come!
